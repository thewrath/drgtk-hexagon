* Ideas
  - Each tiles handle resources
    - Type of resources :
      - Wheat (Gold to create field)
      - Population (Gold to create building, taxes => gold)
      - Gold (earn with taxes)
      - Army (Wheat + Population)
    - Type of tiles :
      - Castle (only one that the player need to defend).
      - Field (to grow resource (wheat that soldier consume)).
      - Building (Building for the soldiers to settle and have population).
      - Neutral => army can go
  - Card effect is for a ring of tiles (player need to dose).
    - Card effects :
      - Create Army (only useable on castle and row with a building tile)
      - Randomly turn a tile in another (building) (need gold)
      - Fertilize field (damage to building) (need gold)
      - Castle enhancements :
        - More PV
        - Can handle more gold
        - ...
  - Special effect for tiles neighborhood :
    - Building => become big building with two other building around
    - Field => more productive if form a line
    - 
  - Army can take take control of castle (they create soldier).
  - Each row played the game update (army move, field grow, ...) (CryptoDancer ?). 
* Todo
  - [x] Draw deck
  - [x] Draw hand
  - [x] Handle card event
  - [] Homogenize API (view, model and use tick instead of update/draw)
